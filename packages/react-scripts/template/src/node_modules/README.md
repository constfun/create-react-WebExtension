# Project local node_modules

This `[root]/src/node_modules` directory contains code that can be imported absolutely anywhere in the project. Like so:
```
import checkFeature from '@app/check-feature';
```

It is important to namespace your modules to avoid name clashes with packages that were installed into `[root]/node_modules` by your package manager.

Unlike `[root]/node_modules`, you should commit this directory.  
Or, delete it if you don't need absolute imports.

> NOTE:  
>
> Create React App suggest setting `NODE_PATH=src` (or any other directory) in your `.env` file as a way to get absolute imports to work within a project. You can do this, but the `NODE_PATH` environment variable is deprecated and this approach will not work with TypeScript, for one.
